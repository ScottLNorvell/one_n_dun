# One 'n' Dun

One 'n' Dun works with Foursquare to limit the amount of time you spend at certain venues. 

One 'n' Dun keeps track of when you check in to flagged venues and provides the opportunity to set a timer and make a wager. If you don't check in at your specified "Home" before the time runs out, your wager goes to a charity that you HATE!

Unfortunately One 'n' Dun relied heavily on replies to checkins, a service that Foursquare discontinued. The alternative solution is to create a mobile app and respond to flagged checkins with push notifications.

If you believe in One 'n' Dun, why not fork the project and make an Android or iOS app out of it!
